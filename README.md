# Easy Permissions

Android requires that these request come from an `Activity`. With Easy Permissions this is no longer an issue, you may request permission from anywhere as long as you provide `Context`. In addition, if you request a permission that is already granted the user will not be prompted.

## How to Use 

### Setup

Include the below dependencies in your `build.gradle` project.

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "http://code.newtronlabs.com:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.3'
        classpath 'com.newtronlabs.android:plugin:2.0.1'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "http://code.newtronlabs.com:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" }
    }
}

subprojects {
    apply plugin: 'com.newtronlabs.android'
}
```

In the `build.gradle` for your app.

```gradle
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'com.newtronlabs.easypermissions:easypermissions:2.1.4'
}
```

### Request Permission
As long as you have context you can request a permission from anywhere. Make sure you implement `IPermissionsListener` to receive information about what is happening with your permission request.

#### Example 1
This example uses a `Service` to request the permission, something native Android does not allow. It also automatically requests the permissions that you have enabled on your Manifest.

```java
public class ExampleService extends Service implements IPermissionsListener
{
    @Override
    public void onCreate()
    {
        super.onCreate();
        
        // Will request all permissions from the Manifest automatically.
        EasyPermissions.getInstance().requestPermissions(this, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void onRequestSent(Set<String> set)
    {
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure()
    {
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onCompleted(Set<String> grantedPermissions, Set<String> deniedPermissions)
    {
    }
}
```



#### Example 2
This example uses a `Service` to request the permission, something native Android does not allow. This example allows more flexibility so that you can decide which permissions you desire.

```java
public class ExampleService extends Service implements IPermissionsListener
{
    @Override
    public void onCreate()
    {
        super.onCreate();

        // Request as many permissions as you like. You may seperate them by commas or pass an array.
        // Make sure that these permissions are in your Manifest as well.
        EasyPermissions.getInstance().requestPermissions(this, this,
                Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
                Manifest.permission.CAMERA,
                Manifest.permission.CALL_PHONE,
                Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE);
    }

    @Override
    public void onRequestSent(Set<String> set)
    {
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure()
    {
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onCompleted(Set<String> grantedPermissions, Set<String> deniedPermissions)
    {
    }
}
```


#### Always add the permission to your AndroidManifest.xml

As a requirement permissions must be in the Manifest.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
 ```
